# Parallax on ASIC

This is a small experimental ASIC project that renders procedural 2D scrolling terrain with stars using LFSRs and generates VGA 640x480 signal.

This experiment is a part of multi project submission to the Google/Efabless/Skywater shuttle.

The code is base upon the following FPGA examples:
* [Matt's VGA Clock repo](https://github.com/mattvenn/vga-clock)
* [Will Green's Project F](https://projectf.io/sitemap/#fpga-graphics)
* [Steven Hugg's FPGA examples for 8bitworkshop.com](https://github.com/sehugg/fpga-examples)
